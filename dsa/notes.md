### The NeetCode DSA Roadmap: A Phased Approach

The core principle of this roadmap is to build from the ground up. You start with the most common data structures and patterns, and each new topic leverages the knowledge from the previous ones.

#### Tier 1: The Core Toolkit (The Absolute Essentials)

This is your foundation. Master these patterns, and you'll be able to solve a huge percentage of interview questions. For you, with 6 years of experience, this might be part revision, part deepening your understanding of the *patterns* themselves.

1.  **Arrays & Hashing**
    *   **What it is:** The bedrock of data storage. This section focuses on using arrays and, crucially, hash maps (dictionaries in Python) to solve problems efficiently.
    *   **Why it's first:** It's the most fundamental and common pattern. Mastering the use of hash maps for O(1) lookups is a superpower.

2.  **Two Pointers**
    *   **What it is:** A clever technique for iterating through an array or list. You use two different pointers that move through the data to solve problems involving searching, pairing, or subarrays.
    *   **Why it's here:** It builds directly on your array skills and teaches you how to optimize from a brute-force O(nÂ²) solution to a linear O(n) one.

3.  **Sliding Window**
    *   **What it is:** A specific type of two-pointer technique used for problems involving a contiguous subarray or substring (e.g., "find the longest substring with no repeating characters").
    *   **Why it's here:** It's a powerful and frequently asked pattern. It solidifies your ability to think about linear-time optimizations.

4.  **Stack**
    *   **What it is:** A Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) data structure. Problems often involve parentheses validation, or finding the "next greater element."
    *   **Why it's here:** It's a simple but essential data structure with unique applications that other structures can't handle as elegantly.

5.  **Binary Search**
    *   **What it is:** The classic algorithm for searching in a *sorted* array. The real skill is learning to apply it to problems that aren't obviously about searching, like finding the minimum value in a rotated array.
    *   **Why it's here:** It introduces logarithmic time complexity (O(log n)), a huge leap in efficiency.

6.  **Linked List**
    *   **What it is:** A fundamental data structure where elements point to the next one in the sequence. Problems involve reversing lists, detecting cycles, and merging.
    *   **Why it's here:** It forces you to master pointer manipulation and thinking about memory references, which is crucial for understanding more complex structures like trees and graphs.

#### Tier 2: Non-Linear Structures & Recursion

Once you've mastered linear data, you move to hierarchical data and the recursive thinking needed to navigate it.

7.  **Trees**
    *   **What it is:** Hierarchical data structures. This is a large topic, but the focus is on understanding traversals (In-order, Pre-order, Post-order), Breadth-First Search (BFS), and Depth-First Search (DFS).
    *   **Why it's here:** Trees are everywhere in computer science (file systems, DOM, databases). Mastering tree traversal is non-negotiable and is the gateway to understanding graphs.

8.  **Tries (Prefix Tree)**
    *   **What it is:** A special kind of tree used for efficient string searching and autocomplete features.
    *   **Why it's here:** It's a perfect example of a specialized data structure that is incredibly efficient for its specific use case. It builds directly on your tree knowledge.

9.  **Heap / Priority Queue**
    *   **What it is:** A tree-based data structure that allows you to efficiently find the minimum or maximum element.
    *   **Why it's here:** It's the go-to tool for any problem that involves "top K elements," "most frequent K elements," or efficient scheduling.

10. **Backtracking**
    *   **What it is:** A recursive technique for exploring all possible solutions to a problem and "backing up" when a path doesn't work. Think Sudoku solvers, permutations, and combinations.
    *   **Why it's here:** This is where you truly master recursion. It's a powerful algorithmic concept that formalizes the "brute-force with brains" approach.

#### Tier 3: The Advanced Frontier (Graphs & DP)

These are often considered the most challenging topics. They require you to combine patterns from the previous tiers.

11. **Graphs**
    *   **What it is:** The most versatile data structure, representing networks of nodes and connections. Problems involve traversals (BFS, DFS), finding clones, and detecting cycles.
    *   **Why it's here:** Graphs model real-world networks (social, computer, road). This is a critical topic for senior roles, especially in backend systems. Your tree traversal skills (BFS/DFS) are directly applicable here.

12. **Advanced Graphs**
    *   **What it is:** More complex graph algorithms like Dijkstra's for shortest paths and algorithms for Minimum Spanning Trees.
    *   **Why it's here:** These are more specialized but essential for problems in network routing and infrastructure optimization.

13. **1-D Dynamic Programming (DP)**
    *   **What it is:** A technique for solving complex problems by breaking them into simpler, overlapping subproblems and storing their results to avoid re-computation.
    *   **Why it's here:** This is the start of the DP journey. It teaches the core concepts of memoization and tabulation on simple, linear problems (e.g., Climbing Stairs, Coin Change).

14. **2-D Dynamic Programming (DP)**
    *   **What it is:** Applying DP concepts to grid or matrix-based problems.
    *   **Why it's here:** This builds on 1-D DP and is used for a wide range of pathfinding and optimization problems on 2D surfaces.

#### Tier 4: Specialized Patterns

These are important patterns that are often self-contained or combine multiple ideas from the tiers above.

15. **Greedy Algorithms**
    *   **What it is:** Building up a solution by always making the locally optimal choice at each step.
    *   **Why it's here:** It's a different way of thinking about optimization problems. The challenge is knowing *when* a greedy approach will work.

16. **Intervals**
    *   **What it is:** A common problem category involving ranges or time intervals (e.g., meeting rooms, merging overlapping intervals).
    *   **Why it's here:** These problems often require a combination of sorting (a core skill) and a greedy or merging approach.

17. **Math & Geometry**
    *   **What it is:** Problems that require clever mathematical insights or manipulation of points in a coordinate system.

18. **Bit Manipulation**
    *   **What it is:** Solving problems by manipulating the individual bits of numbers. Can lead to incredibly fast and memory-efficient solutions.

### How to Study This Roadmap

*   **Go in Order:** The sequence is designed for a reason. Don't jump to Graphs before you've mastered Trees.
*   **The 3-Step Method for Each Problem:**
    1.  **Attempt:** Try to solve it on your own for 25-30 minutes.
    2.  **Learn:** If stuck, don't just look at the code. Watch the NeetCode video explanation to understand the *logic* and the *pattern*. This is the most critical step.
    3.  **Implement:** Write the code yourself from your new understanding. Don't just copy.
*   **Spaced Repetition:** After solving a problem, plan to revisit it 1 week later, then 1 month later to ensure the pattern sticks in your long-term memory.
