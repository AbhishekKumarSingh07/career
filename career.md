# My Career Development Roadmap: The Pragmatic Tech Leader

This document is my personal action plan for career growth. It's designed to be a living document that I will update as I progress.

## Core Philosophy

My goal is to become a **Pragmatic Tech Leader**. This means I will actively cultivate a blend of:

1.  **Technical Mastery:** Having the deep technical credibility to design robust systems and mentor others.
2.  **Practical Innovation:** Being at the forefront of new technology (like Gen AI) by building real-world applications.
3.  **Business & Leadership Acumen:** Understanding the "why" behind the "what" and developing the skills to lead teams and projects.

## Guiding Principles

*   **Learn by Doing:** I learn best by building, not by theory alone.
*   **Maintain Momentum:** I will learn while working, without taking a long career break.
*   **Consistency over Intensity:** Small, consistent efforts lead to massive results over time.

## The Roadmap

### Phase 1: The Foundation (Next 6-9 Months)

*Goal: Build parallel tracks of Technical Authority and Practical Innovation.*

#### Track A: Technical Authority (The DSA Grind)

*   **Why:** To build the fundamental problem-solving skills of a top-tier senior engineer, boost my confidence, and unlock future opportunities.

*   **Action Plan:**
    *   [ ] **Commit to Consistency:** Dedicate 5-7 hours per week to focused DSA practice.
    *   [ ] **Choose My Weapon:** Use Python for all practice and study.
    *   [ ] **Follow a Structured Path:** Systematically work through the [NeetCode Roadmap](https://neetcode.io/roadmap).
    *   [ ] **Focus on Patterns:** My goal is not just to solve problems, but to deeply understand the underlying patterns (e.g., Sliding Window, Two Pointers, Graph Traversals).

#### Track B: Practical Innovation (The Gen AI Project)

*   **Why:** To gain hands-on experience in the most relevant new field, leverage my existing backend skills, and discover if I enjoy this type of work.

*   **Action Plan:**
    *   [ ] **Build a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) System.** This is the cornerstone project.
        *   [ ] **Backend:** Set up a project using FastAPI.
        *   [ ] **Data Source:** Choose a set of documents to be the "knowledge base" (e.g., project documentation, a book, Wikipedia articles).
        *   [ ] **Ingestion Pipeline:**
            *   [ ] Write a script to load and chunk the documents.
            *   [ ] Use an embedding model (e.g., OpenAI `text-embedding-3-small` or a free model from Hugging Face) to create vectors.
            *   [ ] Store the vectors and their corresponding text in a Vector Database (start with a simple one like ChromaDB or SQLite with a vector extension).
        *   [ ] **Query API:**
            *   [ ] Create an API endpoint `/ask`.
            *   [ ] It should take a user question, embed it, and query the Vector DB to find the most relevant context chunks.
            *   [ ] Feed the context and the question to an LLM (via OpenAI API or a local model with Ollama) to generate the final answer.

### Phase 2: The Leverage (Months 9-18)

*Goal: Translate new skills into visible impact and leadership.*

#### At My Current Job

*   [ ] **Become the Go-To Person:** Actively participate in code reviews and system design discussions, applying my improved DSA knowledge.
*   [ ] **Be an Innovator:** Create a small Proof-of-Concept using Gen AI to solve a real problem at my company. Share it with my manager/team.
*   [ ] **Start Mentoring:** Find a junior engineer to mentor, even informally. Explaining concepts will solidify my own understanding.

#### "MBA-Lite" Learning

*   [ ] **Read for Strategy:** Read one book from this list every 2-3 months.
    *   [ ] *Designing Data-Intensive Applications* by Martin Kleppmann
    *   [ ] *The Mythical Man-Month* by Fred Brooks
    *   [ ] *An Elegant Puzzle: Systems of Engineering Management* by Will Larson
*   [ ] **Listen for Insights:** Subscribe to 1-2 podcasts on engineering leadership or tech strategy.

### Phase 3: The Crossroads, Revisited (18+ Months From Now)

*Goal: Re-evaluate from a position of strength and choose the next big step.*

By this point, I will have the skills and experience to confidently pursue one of these paths:

*   **Path 1: The Staff Engineer:** Target high-level Individual Contributor roles, leveraging deep technical and system design skills.
*   **Path 2: The AI Specialist:** Pivot fully into an "AI Engineer" or "ML Engineer" role, backed by strong backend fundamentals.
*   **Path 3: The Tech Lead / Manager:** Move into a formal leadership role, using my project and mentorship experience as a launchpad.

> **Motto:** The goal isn't to choose one path today, but to build the skills to walk any path tomorrow.
