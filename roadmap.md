### **My DSA Learning Journey (Python)**

This note serves as my personal roadmap and resource hub for mastering Data Structures and Algorithms using Python. The goal is to follow this path consistently, practice diligently, and build a strong foundation for problem-solving and backend engineering excellence.

**Core Philosophy:**
1.  **Understand the Concept:** First, grasp the theory and intuition behind each data structure or algorithm.
2.  **Code it from Scratch:** Implement it in Python to solidify understanding.
3.  **Use Python's Built-ins:** Learn how to use Python's optimized, built-in versions (e.g., `list`, `dict`, `heapq`).
4.  **Solve Problems:** Apply the knowledge to solve problems on platforms like LeetCode.

**Final Advice:**
*   **Consistency is Key:** Aim to study for 1-2 hours every day rather than cramming on weekends.
*   **Practice, Practice, Practice:** After learning a topic, immediately go to **LeetCode** and solve 5-10 problems related to it. Start with "Easy" and work your way up.
*   **Code Along:** Don't just watch the videos. Pause, open your editor, and code it yourself. Break it, fix it, understand it.
*   **Review:** Use a spaced repetition system (like flashcards or just revisiting old topics) to ensure concepts stick.
